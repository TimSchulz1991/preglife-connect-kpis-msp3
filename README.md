# Preglife Connect KPI Capture

While thinking about what to do for my 3rd milestone project, I decided against creating a random game or program, but instead wanted to build something that is useful to me in my daily work with my app startup Preglife Connect. I am responsible for keeping track of the app's development, so I decided that a KPI capture program, which also informs me about current trends, could be really useful.
